      <title>Watching wildfire with radar, the return of race science, laundry and microplastic, submarines for your bloodstream and oxygen for airplanes.</title>
      <description>New high-powered radar gives scientists a 3D view of wildfires in real time; The return of race science — the quest to fortify racism with bad biology; Your laundry and plastic pollution — which fabrics shed the most microplastics; Tiny submarines could make a &apos;fantastic voyage&apos; into our bodies; How do high-flying airplanes have enough oxygen for their engines?</description>

DNA shows what our noses know; Bonobo mothers act as wing-mums for their sons; A research assistant named Spongebob? Sea sponges collect data for science; Do electric car batteries take more CO2 to make than they save?</description>

      <title>Should we have humans in space? A Quirks &amp; Quarks public debate</title>
      <description>In our first ever Quirks &amp; Quarks public debate, recorded live in Toronto, astronaut Chris Hadfield, cosmologist Renée Hložek, planetary scientist Marianne Mader and space flight historian Amy Shira Teitel weigh in on whether we should leave space to the robots.  An extended podcast edition includes Q&amp;A segments not in the radio broadcast.</description>

      <title>The benefits of video games, composting corpses, brewing ancient beer, right whales in the wrong place and supernovas and bipedalism</title>
      <description>Video games aren&apos;t corrupting young minds - they may be building them; Don&apos;t bury or cremate - soon you may compost your corpse; Drink like an Egyptian - 5000 year old yeast is resurrected to brew ancient beer; Right whales were in the wrong place because of the wrong climate; Did our ancestors evolve to walk upright because of supernovae?</description>

Tiger sharks are somehow eating songbirds; Fungus fossils shows the complexity of Earth&apos;s life a billion-years-ago; Scientists create robot-like biomaterial with key traits of life; Ancient beavers as big as bears died out because of their woodless diet; No, really, calculus can be beautiful and this mathematician will tell us why; What happens to oil spills after dispersant is used?</description>
